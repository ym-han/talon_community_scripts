# Changes Made After Problematic Rebase

## Summary
This document tracks the changes made to fix issues that occurred after the failed rebase at commit 09b0777c (HEAD@{11}) to da6d2e82. The rebase introduced breaking changes due to architectural updates in the upstream codebase.

## Files Changed Since Rebase (09b0777c..HEAD)

### 1. `.gitignore` - Reorganized
**Status**: Modified (M)
**Changes**:
- Reorganized private file exclusions into a cleaner section
- Added section comment "# Personal/private files - keep local only"
- Moved `private.talon` and `core/websites_and_search_engines/website.talon-list` into organized section
- No functional changes, just better organization

### 2. `core/edit/edit.talon` - Fixed Merge Conflicts
**Status**: Modified (M)
**Changes**:
- Removed merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, etc.)
- Fixed command naming consistency:
  - `copy header` → `copy file head`
  - `copy tailor` → `copy file tail`
- Cleaned up duplicate/conflicting sections
- Removed trailing whitespace

### 3. `private.talon` - Deleted
**Status**: Deleted (D)
**Reason**: File contained sensitive personal information (emails, tokens, SSH credentials)
**Content that was lost**:
- Personal email and name phrases
- Git authentication token (now expired, need to regenerate)
- SSH commands for Oscar/Brown University access
- Co-author template for commits

## Architecture Issues Detected (In Working Directory)

### Core Breaking Changes from Upstream
The rebase revealed that upstream removed `get_list_from_csv` function on 2024-09-07, replacing it with `track_csv_list` decorator. Several files still use the old API:

#### 1. `core/keys/keys.py`
- **Issue**: Still imports `get_list_from_csv` (line 3)
- **Issue**: Uses old function call pattern (line 19-21)
- **Issue**: References non-existent variables `punctuation_dict`, `symbol_key_dict` (lines 265-266)
- **Issue**: Has debug print statement (line 78)
- **Issue**: Incomplete action decorator (line 264)
- **Issue**: Duplicate `ctx = Context()` declaration (line 119)

#### 2. `core/abbreviate/abbreviate.py`
- **Issue**: Still imports `get_list_from_csv` (line 3)
- **Issue**: Uses old function call pattern (lines 450-454)

#### 3. Other files likely affected
- May be other files using the deprecated `get_list_from_csv` function

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working
- Git repository is in a consistent state
- Working directory is clean (no staged changes)
- Personal customizations are preserved in the commit history

### What's Broken
- Talon likely can't load due to import errors from `get_list_from_csv`
- Voice bindings for keys and abbreviations probably non-functional
- Some merge conflicts may still exist in working files

## Planned Resolution Strategy

1. **Reset to pre-rebase state** (09b0777c) to restore working configuration
2. **Use merge instead of rebase** for upstream integration
3. **Fix architecture issues** during merge conflict resolution using `track_csv_list`
4. **Restore personal files** like `private.talon` (with updated tokens)
5. **Enable git rerere** to prevent repeated conflict resolution

## Personal Customizations to Preserve

### Voice Bindings
- "lap" for enter key (vs upstream "clap")
- Various symbol customizations ("rbrace" → "R brace", etc.)
- Custom alphabet pronunciations

### File Structure
- Extensive CSV customizations in `settings/`
- Personal command files in `core/personal/`
- Private overrides and credentials

### App Integrations
- Custom GDB commands
- Anaconda/conda voice commands
- Specialized terminal bindings
