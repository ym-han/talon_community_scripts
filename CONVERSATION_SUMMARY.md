# Conversation Summary - Talon Rebase Issues

## Initial Problem
User reported that `keys.py` looked broken after a rebase, asking to check if it was using the same architecture as latest community scripts.

## Issues Found
**core/keys/keys.py (lines 3, 19-21, 85, 132, 275-276):**
- Using removed `get_list_from_csv` function (deprecated 2024-09-07)
- Should use `track_csv_list` decorator instead
- Debug print statement left in code
- Duplicate `ctx = Context()` declaration
- References to non-existent variables
- Incomplete action class decorator

**core/abbreviate/abbreviate.py (lines 3, 450-454):**
- Same `get_list_from_csv` issue

## Root Cause
Rebase reverted user's previous migration work. Breaking change: `get_list_from_csv` → `track_csv_list` decorator (per BREAKING_CHANGES.txt).

## User Context
- Maintains personal fork with ~200 changed files
- Extensive voice binding customizations ("lap" for enter, etc.)
- Has done migration work before that got reverted by rebase

## Solutions Discussed
1. **Git merge conflict algorithm** - explained why conflicts occur
2. **Git rerere** - auto-resolves repeated conflicts
3. **Merge vs Rebase** - merge is easier for user's extensive customizations
4. **Feasibility of reset** - yes, can reset to pre-rebase state and use merge instead

## Current Plan
Reset to pre-rebase state → enable rerere → merge upstream → fix architecture issues → test → commit

## Files We Fixed (before reset)
- Updated both keys.py and abbreviate.py to use `track_csv_list`
- Cleaned up syntax errors and debug statements
- But will lose these fixes when we reset (will redo during merge)
